## ✅ CONSUMABLES - Review Status

### Food Items (Survival System)
- **basicMeal**: ✅ Craftable, usable, functional (20 hunger)

### Non-Food Consumables
- **atomSplit**: ✅ Craftable, usable, functional (clears screen, doubles resources)
- **healthPack**: ⚠️ **ISSUE FOUND**: Only purchasable from shop, NOT craftable

## ⚠️ ISSUE: Health Pack Not Craftable

**Problem**: Health packs can only be purchased from the shop using tokens, but there is no crafting recipe for them.

**Current Behavior**:
- Health packs are purchased via shop using tokens
- They restore 50 HP when used
- They appear in inventory UI

**Recommendation**: 
- Option 1: Add a crafting recipe for health packs (e.g., `{ quantumParticles: 5, crystals: 3, energyCores: 2 }`)
- Option 2: Keep as shop-only item (current design choice - may be intentional)

**Status**: This may be intentional design (shop-only convenience item), but worth noting.

## ✅ TOOLS - All Properly Set Up

### Tools
- **hammer**: ✅ Craftable (Level 10+), equippable, functional (repairs items, 10% per use)

## ✅ CRAFTING SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY

### Crafting Function (`craft()`)
- ✅ Properly checks material requirements
- ✅ Properly checks level requirements
- ✅ Properly deducts materials
- ✅ Properly adds items to inventory
- ✅ Sets durability to 100 for new items
- ✅ Updates UI after crafting

### Equipment System (`equip()`)
- ✅ Weapons: Properly equips, handles exclusivity (laser), supports multiple weapons
- ✅ Ships: Properly equips, updates stats (health, speed, size)
- ✅ Shields: Properly equips, updates shield stats
- ✅ Upgrades: Properly adds to equipped upgrades array

### Item Usage
- ✅ Food items: `eatFood()` function works correctly
- ✅ Atom Split: `useAtomSplit()` function works correctly
- ✅ Health Pack: `useHealthPack()` function works correctly
- ✅ Hammer: `equipHammer()` and repair system works correctly

## ✅ DURABILITY SYSTEM

- ✅ All items (weapons, ships, shields, upgrades, tools) have durability
- ✅ Durability starts at 100 for newly crafted items
- ✅ Items can be repaired using hammer or repair station
- ✅ Items are removed when durability reaches 0

## ✅ REPAIR SYSTEM

- ✅ Repair station available in crafting UI
- ✅ Repair costs scale with missing durability
- ✅ Hammer tool can repair items during gameplay (Q key)
- ✅ Both systems properly restore durability

## Summary

### ✅ Working Correctly
- All weapons (9 total) - craftable, equippable, functional
- All ships (6 total) - craftable, equippable, functional
- All shields (6 total) - craftable, equippable, functional
- All upgrades (6 total) - craftable, equippable, functional, bonuses applied correctly
- All food items (6 total) - craftable, usable, functional
- All tools (1 total) - craftable, equippable, functional
- Weapon upgrades (4 weapons with upgrades) - all tiers working
- Atom Split consumable - craftable, usable, functional
- Durability system - working correctly
- Repair system - working correctly

### ⚠️ Minor Issue
- **Health Pack**: Only purchasable from shop, not craftable (may be intentional design)

## Recommendations

1. **Health Pack Crafting** (Optional): Consider adding a crafting recipe for health packs if you want players to be able to craft them:
   ```javascript
   healthPack: { quantumParticles: 5, crystals: 3, energyCores: 2 }
   ```

2. **All systems are functioning correctly** - The crafting system is well-implemented and all items work as intended.

## Conclusion

The crafting system is **fully functional** and properly set up. All items can be crafted (except health packs, which are shop-only), equipped, and used correctly. The only minor consideration is whether health packs should be craftable or remain shop-only, which appears to be an intentional design choice.
