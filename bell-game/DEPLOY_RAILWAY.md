# Deploy Backend to Railway - Step by Step

Your code is now on GitHub! Let's deploy the backend server.

## Step 1: Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to**: https://railway.app (should be open now)
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Click**: "New Project"
4. **Select**: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. **Authorize** Railway to access your GitHub
6. **Select**: `MorninRage/beyond-bell-game` repository
7. **Click**: "Add Service"
8. **In the service settings**:
   - Click on the service
   - Go to **Settings** tab
   - Find **Root Directory**
   - Set it to: `server`
   - Click **Save**
9. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and start deploying
10. **Wait** 1-2 minutes for deployment
11. **Copy your Railway URL** (e.g., `https://beyond-bell-game.up.railway.app`)

## Step 2: Update Game Config

After you get your Railway URL, I'll update `config.js` with it.

## Step 3: Deploy Game to Netlify

Then we'll deploy the game itself to Netlify!

**Once Railway gives you a URL, tell me and I'll update the config file!**
